# DotsPong
 Game of Pong using unity DOTS. 

Started from the unity dots tutorial since it has change a LOT since I last followed up on the development of the framework
Took the tutorial 
changed some behavior to better fit my tastes
added some ai behavior so you can have the game run on its own, or play with your friends

sadly dots and audio is still a weird undocumented valley of unknowns, therefore there is a distinct lack of it
